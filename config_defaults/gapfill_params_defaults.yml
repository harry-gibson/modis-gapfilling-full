# The despeckle and gapfill algorithms search for neighbour cells in an outward spiral i.e. an
# increasing search radius until enough neighbours are found for the checks or until the maximum radius is reached.
# Define the size of the search and the number of neighbours required. For A1 this determines the fill radius i.e.
# the size of gap that can be filled.
# All MODIS gapfilling done in MAP since 2014 has used the following parameters which give an effective search
# radius of approx 31 pixels (i.e. sqrt(3142/pi)) and requires slightly more neighbours for fill than despeckle

    pass_averaging_method: Mean # Mean/Median: how to pick from the 8 directional pass fill values. Mean is more efficient.

Flags: # Flags are stored in a bitmask so must be powers of two. Do not adjust without careful thought
